# California-and-miami-housing-data
This is a github repo of our final project on California and Miami Housing datasets. 
We did EDA (exploratory data analysis) and removed outliers/skewness of data.
We examined a California Housing Dataset and Miami Housing Dataset and performed machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Knn, Random Forest, and Neural Network. 
From our analysis, we determine the factors that predict housing prices in different locations.
